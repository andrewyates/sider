# SIDER – Side Effect Resource

This repository contains list of filters that can be used as errata for the SIDER database. To provide a stable reference point, the web version and download files are not continuously updated. However, researchers using SIDER can refer to this repository to reduce false positives. To ensure reproducibility, the version of the repository should be recorded.

These files are:

* `adr_concepts_to_exclude` – a list of UMLS ids (and concept names) that most likely do not refer to side effects
* `meddra_freq_to_exclude.tsv` – a list of lines from meddra_freq.tsv.gz that should be excluded from analysis
